Another day, it's like a new beginning
And so today I know that it's a new start
I know the bad times are disappearing
'Cause now I know that we'll never be apart

You're the one that makes me feel so high
Just like a diamond in the sky
I never want to hear you say goodbye
Just like a diamond in the sky
